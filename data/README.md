This directory contains split videos, one for each angle of light. Currently, the duration between the shots is not measured.

Each video directory also contains an "images" directory. In these there are examples of taking 2 images out of the video and doing background segmentation on them. For now, I also keep the model's prediction.

Right now, these files are too big to be stored on GitHub. Therefore they are only stored on stinger.
